The spaceship battle simulator game developed in Unity 2D for the college course group project is an exciting and innovative gaming experience that focuses on AI battles. Unlike traditional games that rely on player input, this game allows players to choose two teams of spaceships and watch as the teams engage in battles automatically.

## Gameplay

In the Battle Starfleet, players select a team of spaceships from a drop-down menu and start the simulation to observe AI-controlled battles. Players can control the camera with the mouse, reset or end the simulation using on-screen keys, and customize the gameplay experience with fullscreen and vsync options.
