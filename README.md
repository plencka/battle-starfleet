# battle-starfleet
A group college project thing.

## Setup

### Unity
The target Unity version for the project is a stable `2020.3.24f1 LTS` build. It's endorsed to use that version for best compatibility.

> To import the project, clone the repository to a desired location and open the project's root directory using the `ADD` button in Unity Hub. 
> It should show up on a list of projects if done correctly.

Properly configured project (in initial commit) should display a blinking, rotating texture located in the middle of the starting scene in Play Game mode.

I don't guarantee it will work out-of-the-box, as I never had luck with Package Manager.

### Forks
As a contributor, it's not recommended to fork a repository for development. 
Instead you can contribute directly to the main remote by using steps provided below.
After you're done with the project, you're welcome to fork the project to attach it to your own profile.

## Contributing
To ensure ease of work and no headaches, consider following provided steps:

> 1. Before making changes, create an issue and/or assign yourself to be sure we're not working on the same thing.

> 2. Use issues to discuss ideas, bugs and features.
> - ....Instead of external communicators and making my phone ring at 4:00am...
> - Or having to scroll a conversation to find a thing mentioned a week ago. 
> - Alternatively just copy any important information into issues.

> 3. Create branches for each independant feature. I don't think `camera-controller` branch should contain changes related to AI logic.
> - You can also attach a number of related issue for more visual feedback to the naming scheme.
> - Keep names relevant, so nobody will wonder what `testing-test` branch is for. Same for commits. :rage:

> 4. You may notice that you're not able to push changes directly to the `main` branch. 
> This repository requires Pull Requests which need to be approved by other contributors. 
> - Pull Requests can be created from different branches. 
> - In others words: Don't worry, you shouldn't be able to delete the project by accident.

> 5. If you have trouble doing something and it stalls your development, communicate. Others might know and save your time.

> 6. If it's broken, don't make a Pull Request (unless it's a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) and you need help).

> 7. If I forgot to mention anything and you're stuck, or you don't agree with something, ask. :slightly_smiling_face:
